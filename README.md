# Model a Day in May
A challenge I have set for myself to create a model a day in May 2020. Each day, I will give myself one hour to find a dataset, perform some basic analysis, and create a machine learning model to predict some value.

## Goals
* Learn python, SciKitLearn, and Jupyter
* Challenge myself to become faster at data analysis and modelling
* Initially, to do superficial analysis and modelling. Eventually, with enough analysis and modelling with existing data, learn new ML algorithms or explore deeper analysis on already-solved problems
